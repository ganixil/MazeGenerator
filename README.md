# MazeGenerator

This is a project I developed for the SBU CSE 328 course, which is fundemental for computer graphics

This projects use OpenGL and C++ to generate image of mazes

The user will be able to specify the boundary of the maze using left click on the GLUT specified area, and right click to finish the the boundary

A maze will be automatically generated inside the boundary using Recursive backtracker
